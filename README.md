# Windows Live Writer Code Tag Plugin

This is a plugin for the Windows Live Writer blogging software that wraps a selection with the HTML `<code>` tag.

To install it, build the assembly and drop it in the `%ProgramFiles%\Windows Live\Writer\Plugins\` folder. When you restart WLW, you should see a `<code> HTML tag` option. Select some text and use that to wrap it in `<code></code>` tags.
